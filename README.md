This plugin can contain your site's core functionality. It contains the following library structure; however, it can be expanded greatly:

* metaboxes.php -- for registering custom metaboxes

* post-types.php -- for registering custom post types

* shortcodes.php -- for writing custom shortcodes

* sidebars.php -- for registering custom sidebars

* taxonomies.php -- for custom taxonomies

## Additional Scripts ##

UC Santa Cruz hosts WordPress and Drupal sites at [Pantheon.io](https://pantheon.io). Pantheon hosts their own Git repositories. Pantheon's Git repositories consist of the entire [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) install (minus ``/wp-content/uploads/`` directory, which can be synced using [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)).
